There are loads of people who do the walk with buggies/strollers BUT some parts are steep and a few \"short cuts\" towards the top are over big stones and not suitable for strollers, but going round is no big deal and won't take much longer. I personally think that anything under 3 hours with a stroller is very optimistic, but it really depends on how fit you are. The walk around the lake or to Black Pond at the top is not suitable for a stroller, but there's a great cafÃ© with long tables and benches in front of the lake to enjoy the view. Have a great time"}
